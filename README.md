	Extreme simplory music player wrote in Vanilla Javascript. But works... 

## Description

	Since that I decide that I'm done with "free" music radios I've been building this 
	modest but sincer music player for my and my family's enjoyment.
	
	I hope nothing special, just enough and if possible with a cool design(according my taste)
	
	The system is very simple! There is a JSON file with all music. System loads this file
	and builds a "tree of music" hierarchically divided by artist > album > track. Everything else is
	around of this including searching engine, playlists and music player itself.
	
	The music player can receive music from the main tree or from **active playlist**. But, if there is no 
	active playlist set player starts from the first music of the "tree".
	
	Playlists is a list of tracks choosed from the "tree". For now it's possible just 3 playlists. In the
	sooner future I hope this can limit grows to 8. 
	
	

## Version

v0.0.3-rc3

## Features

* Searching engine(by album, artist or track name). Some issues but works...

* 'Almost' theme support

* music list

* NFS mapping. Not required

* Poor documentation

  

## Extra

* Express server for convenience(routes, file server, CORS, etc). You can use any http server. Whatever...

  

# Pre-reqs



* Linux - Debian variants if it's possible
* Node + express + forever for backend - Again, you can use whatever you want but I made using Node.
* local or remote music location mapped on 'mp3' directory



## Installing


1. Installing using Node with express

  * Clone this repo

    `git clone git@github.com:bang/linkmus.git`

    or download from [here](https://github.com/bang/linkmus/archive/master.zip)

  * Install Node and npm

    

    `sudo apt install node npm node-express node-forever-agent`

    

  * Go to repo location and install dependecies with `npm install`

    

  * Open app.js and config the port. 

    

  * exec `forever app.js`

    


2. Installing with another http server

  

  * "Duck duck go" it!

    


3. Mapping NFS(Linux only)

  

  * Enable NFS support on your NFS provider(NAS or wherever...), and don't forget to configure the permissions!

  * open 'get-music' script and edit '$mountpoint' variable

  * run `./get-music` (root privileges/sudo is required)

  * To generate a new JSON music list, run `perl link_creator.pl`

  * move 'list-new.json' file to 'resources' directory

    

  
## Notes for this version

* Searching engine tested on Chrome and Firefox(has issues yet. But it's much better!)

* Appearance on default theme(actually is the only theme right now) is better

  


## Limitations

* Less ugly at the moment...

## Bugs
